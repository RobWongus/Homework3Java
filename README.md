=======
Attempting to use javascripts: random number generators, for loops, and functions to create a responsive password generator. The password generator would allow numbers 0-9, upper case letters, lower case letters, and symbols. The password length should not exceed 128 characters or have less than 8 characters. The password should be generated by a button on the webpage and displayed in a text box above the button when all contidions are met.
